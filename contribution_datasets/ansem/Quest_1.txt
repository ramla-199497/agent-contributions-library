um probably like mid 2020 is where I started paying attention to crypto like closely like I've been paying attention during the like bear Market of 2018 2019 um but my daughter was actually born like October 2019 it's like those first few months I was not looking at markets really at all um and then I saw people talking about D5 and I look was looking at the charts and I looked at Ave and it was like 200x or whatever crazy like run up that did um but for me I was like oh I've seen these Cycles like before I'm assuming it's going to be similar to 2017 2018 um so I was looking to eat um looking at D5 sub I saw D5 run up was crazy um but Bitcoin hadn't moved yet so Bitcoin was still at like 10 like 9 10K and was just like trading sideways and all of the D5 people who are like completely new to crypto um all in on unisoft like that's all that they knew I was asking like isn't anybody buying Bitcoin like is anybody looking at Bitcoin and nobody like nobody was talking or even thinking about Bitcoin really um so I was like okay I must I know the money like of all the people like funds and people crypto native people I know they're gonna eventually rotate back into Bitcoin	Research

12. around that time was actually when I was looking at Solana too like early 2021 I think I first bought it like literally the first day of 2021. um but my my thought process around like which V5 like totals were going to do well I was like there's these basket at the top like the blue chip P5 ones um that have already done well and I'm assuming they're gonna do like well again um and then it's like if ethereum fees are like too high for it to be like prohibitive for people to use because it was like people were kind of talking about that like a little bit towards the end of the year yeah um but like not in a way that everybody was like oh what's the trade like what's the trade because of this and no I've been thinking of it in like that way because it wasn't like there was no really was nothing else for people to be using that was that active um at that point in time it was almost like uh if you use any other chain you're like committing a sin I remember like it would defy summer uh the gas the fees started getting high but it wasn't really until like the beginning of 2021 when nft started popping off that everybody it was like holy [ __ ] these are actually like expensive I think it was good for nfts in retrospect and kind	Discovery, Exploration, Innovation

14. In 2023, a lot of exciting developments have caught attention, particularly in the venture capital and crypto space. The China Group, a venture capital fund, recently appointed a head of research to lead efforts in their crypto-focused fund, TCG Crypto. This fund is part of a larger growth-focused entity that has made early-stage investments in consumer trends, such as Barstool, Food52, and Golden Auctions. These investments are centered on understanding changes in consumer behavior and how they intersect with digital and internet-focused advancements, making crypto a key area of interest.	Technology, Innovation, Society
15. One major focus for 2023 is on mobile-focused applications. With people spending more time on their phones, it’s clear that future trends will heavily depend on what younger generations are doing now. The user experience in crypto, particularly in mobile applications, still has room for improvement. Solana is a prime example of a blockchain platform working towards enhancing the mobile experience through its Solana Mobile Stack, which aims to make crypto interactions more seamless on mobile devices.	E-commerce
16. Mobile usage as a primary method of interacting with the internet is significant, but it's currently hindered by restrictions from major platforms like Apple and Android. This creates challenges for crypto-native apps, which face limitations and high fees on these platforms. Solana's efforts to focus on mobile, particularly with their SMS and Saga initiatives, are noteworthy. The shift towards more open-source environments, such as Android, is seen as a way to circumvent these barriers, and there is hope that native crypto applications will eventually become mobile-first.

17. Another area of interest is the new forms of media emerging in the blockchain space. The potential of raw blockchain data and the insights that can be derived from it is enormous. Understanding this data intimately can give a significant advantage, whether in trading or information gathering. There’s a growing interest in transforming this raw data into media companies or social media environments where users can interact directly on-chain, opening up new possibilities for how people engage with blockchain technology.	Technology
18. Infrastructure is also a crucial focus, especially considering the onboarding of the next 100 million crypto users. The discussion revolves around what kind of infrastructure is needed for these applications to run effectively, including the choice of execution layers and the competition between different blockchain technologies, such as rollups or app chains. This exploration of infrastructure is tied to a broader examination of ecosystems that might not be as closely watched but have strong technical foundations, like Cosmos.	Education, Innovation, Technology
19. As the focus on infrastructure grows, so does the interest in different blockchain ecosystems. The bull market brought a lot of attention to Ethereum, especially during the rise of NFTs and DeFi. However, high transaction costs led to a deeper exploration of alternative ecosystems, sparking a broader discussion about execution layers, app chains, and the technical capabilities of platforms like Cosmos, which is gaining attention for its strong technical stack and ability to build community around its ecosystem.	Innovation, technology, development
20. Everybody's kind of focused on their own individual thing because that's how it's designed—like it's app chains individually. They all communicate with each other via IBC, which is like a generalized messaging system. I do think that the Cosmos SDK and the common law zone are going to blow up a lot this year. There are a ton of applications being built that I think are going to do well; it's just about how to cultivate that community. We saw it with Luna, which unfortunately did not turn out well, but the way they approached it from a business side, not the tech side, was interesting.	Technology, Innovation, Future
21. It's fascinating to see how different teams are going to go about it. I definitely agree that it's been interesting talking with more engineers on the podcast and asking them what other ecosystems they're excited about. Cosmos continuously comes up as one that they're super interested in. I've been trying to talk with more Cosmos engineers as well, and I agree with the idea of general-purpose layer ones. A lot of people rally around specific communities, which is great, but for applications that need a more custom-tailored stack, the Cosmos SDK is excellent for that, although it loses some community aspect because there's not as much hype around it.	Technology, Innovation, Future
22. What I've been super interested in, and honestly where I thought things were headed, is sector-specific ecosystems—like having a DeFi ecosystem, an NFT ecosystem, or a gaming ecosystem. This way, you can keep the composability aspect while also having a larger community. I've found that recently with Say, which is doing a DeFi focus, and I've been super excited about that. I even did a podcast with them recently and am eager to see more of these types of ecosystems popping up in Cosmos.	Innovation
23. People are still trying to find the balance, whether it needs to be one application or sector-specific, and figuring out what the limits are. I think it's true that people are finding what that balance is. Some of those guys in NYC are cool, and I've discovered a decently large crypto community in New York, which I was unaware of until last year. Now, I'm more active in the community, meeting people, because I used to do crypto online and offline with friends from school or other work. But now that I work in crypto, it's everything I do, so it's been cool to see people still rallying around and coming to events, even when prices are down.	Technology
24. The community is stronger now compared to 2017's ICOs and 2018, when there were no products. It feels better because there are actual products you can use, even if the user base isn't as large as in Web 2 companies. But the community has definitely grown stronger, and it's great to see New York building it out. I need to get back to Miami, though; it's too cold here. Miami is beautiful, and I love it because we're on the computer so much throughout the day that when I don't have to be, I want to step out, be close to the beach, and get some sunshine.	Innovation, Technology, Design
25. On the app chain thesis or general-purpose approach, is there anything you're actively looking for or excited about, like any charts that you're interested in, where the tech aligns with the chart and something you're eager to watch for the rest of the year? Or is everything just down only right now? A ton of stuff is down, but I've been looking at some charts that look good right now. I feel like I'm reverting to my trader stage, but there are products that have been able to onboard people, and you can see that in trends in user activity. User growth also aligns with technical charts that look good. One of those charts is actually Optimism, which has recently been doing well, surprising many people.	Technology
26. People wondered why Optimism's fully diluted valuation (FDV) was so high, questioning if the token was even worth it. However, the way they're thinking about modularity and their OP Stack, which they're working on, is interesting. They want to create an SDK for people to build roll-ups, allowing customization of elements like the data availability layer and settlement layer. This flexibility at launch is quite innovative. They've also done a great job with their incentive programs, particularly retroactive funding, where builders on Optimism who create successful applications receive tokens in the future instead of upfront airdrops. This approach has contributed to their high FDV and has been effective, making Optimism one of the charts without bad holders since it's a newer chart.	Evolution
27. Layer twos have been gaining momentum, especially with Polygon onboarding many people into the ecosystem. One Layer Two I'm most excited about is Fuel. John Adler and his team are brilliant, and the way they're thinking about Layer Two trades reminds me of the Layer One trade early last year. People are looking for the Layer Two that will win out, like how Optimism is gaining attention now. Arbitrum will likely get attention when they launch their token, and Fuel could be next. Fuel is building out their Layer Two while also developing dev tools and implementing many Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) that Ethereum developers haven't yet been able to. They have their Fuel VM, which is separate from the EVM, and it's paralyzable, making it more efficient.	Technology, Innovation, Development
28. I'm bullish on virtual machines that do parallel processing. It's essential for the future, given that modern computers have more cores, and parallel processing allows them to take full advantage of those cores. Without parallel processing, you're kind of stuck. The Fuel team is doing great work, and I'm curious if other Layer Twos will implement parallel processing long term. The big conversation this year for Layer Twos revolves around EVM equivalence versus building a separate VM, like Starware's Cairo VM, Fuel, and others, versus EVM-compatible Layer Twos like Arbitrum and Optimism. This competition will be one of the most exciting discussions this year, alongside the debate over data availability layers, as Arbitrum and Polygon are working on custom solutions to keep transaction costs low for settlement.	Technology
29. The whole scaling debate is fascinating, especially as people argue on Twitter about which solution is better, and we're right on the front lines, engaging with the very people writing the foundational papers for the industry. This kind of access is unique to crypto, where you can directly interact with the thought leaders on platforms like Twitter, making it an addicting space. I got into crypto in 2017 through Reddit, but Twitter is much better because you can find and directly engage with the people who are actually writing and shaping the industry.	Climate
30. I think there's a good chance that Ethereum remains deflationary, which is a really strong narrative for the platform. Honestly, I view Ethereum as the safest bet in crypto. They move very slowly, but when they do push upgrades, you can be confident that it won't break. I feel comfortable using the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) because it doesn't change all that much. This consistency allows me to limit technological innovation on the Roll-Ups, making Ethereum the safe bet for many people. It's been fascinating to watch Ethereum and all the research they've put out.	Technology, Innovation, Future
31. In 2018, betting on Ethereum was the contrarian move, but now it's the de facto standard that everyone is rooting for. This doesn't mean it will win by default, but I'm curious to see how they transition to these layer twos and how it will work out over the long term. I'm very interested in how it plays out, but one thing I don't like about Ethereum is the argument around fees. Some people argue that high fees mean the chain is making a ton of revenue, but I hated that argument back in 2021 because it's not sustainable.	"Economics  
Sustainability  
Innovation  "
32. However, the argument around Miner Extractable Value (MEV) is more compelling. If there's a ton of activity on the chain, whether on Roll-Ups or the mainnet, the value from reorganizing blocks could be redistributed effectively to users. I think this is a more sustainable, long-term solution for how blockchains can be profitable. The MEV conversation didn't gain much traction in the past, but now, with all this activity and even in DeFi, it's become a much bigger topic.	"Sustainability  
Innovation  
Technology"
33. I'm a fan of some MEV services, though I need to look closer at the others. For example, there's one on Solana working with the protocol Say, and I think there's a good opportunity for MEV on alternative layer-one chains or app chains. The same arguments about MEV on Ethereum apply to these other chains. Flashbots have become the de facto standard, but it will be interesting to see how other teams approach MEV on these platforms, as it won't look the same as it does on Ethereum.	Technology
34. Regarding decentralized perpetual contracts, GMX has been one of the strongest alts, which I didn't expect. Over the past summer, I wasn't convinced that GMX would outperform everything else, but it has done really well. The way they've structured incentives for traders and liquidity providers is interesting and differentiates them from decentralized alternatives. The biggest challenge for decentralized perps is providing a platform where large traders don't suffer from latency issues, something they wouldn't experience on centralized exchanges like Binance. No platform has yet been able to replicate this fully, but I'm curious to see how close they can get. The goal is to make the latencies super low, which is crucial for broader adoption.	"Technology

Impact  "
35. It's like I feel like we're just started on Layer Two, dude, and now we're already on layer threes. But like for me, the way I'm thinking through it now is like you're going to have application-specific Roll-Ups, and you're going to have generalized Roll-Ups, right? So where layer threes come in, it's like when you have these generalized Roll-Ups that are usually on Ethereum from what I've seen. And then you have these application-specific Roll-Ups, which are going to be L3s like for games or whatever else, that then like go back on top of these generalized Roll-Ups. But alternatively, you can have literally application-specific Roll-Ups at the L2 level instead of like at the L3 level.	"Technology  
Innovation  
Society"
36. There are some teams working on that, like Dimension in Cosmos is one of the teams. I mentioned this last year—some of the teams in Cosmos are kind of like thinking through that. From my point of view, the reason that L3s is like a narrative is only because Ethereum was like the de facto L1 that these Roll-Ups are getting built on. So it's like if you have a really performant base layer, which Ethereum is not, but if you do have a really performant base layer, then like you can go directly to application-specific Roll-Ups instead of building these generalized Roll-Ups. Because it's like you wouldn't really—I don't think people would—the argument for building a generalized Roll-Up on something like Solana is not as strong as the argument for building a generalized Roll-Up on something like Ethereum.	"Innovation  
Technology  
Advancement"
37. Yeah, so that's kind of how I've been thinking through it, but I need to go deeper on it. Dude, I agree though. I mean, really the conversation was like shifting from scaling the L1 to scaling the layer two on Ethereum or using layer twos to scale Ethereum. And then they're like, oh surprise, layer threes. I'm like, it adds a lot of complexity, and so I've just been surprised by it, but I'm definitely curious to watch it play out.	"Technology  
Innovation  
Society"
38. Yeah, I think what's the team—I think it's ZK Sync—has been the main ones talking about it, right? Yeah, I'm interested too, man. I don't know, I'm not even gonna sell it to people because I feel like selling Roll-Ups was hard enough as it is. Are the L3s going to be a completely different VM and language too? To me, it's just like the more complexities that you add, one from the software side, like for developers, but then also like users bridging from an L2 to an L2 or an L2 to L3, like it's just, yeah, flex. And so I would rather—I mean, that's why I'm a big fan of the kind of high throughput systems that try to keep everything on a single shard, just because it's easier for developers and it's easier for users to navigate it.	Technology, Innovation, Future
39. But I think on that front, Ethereum is very, very good at telling stories. Why do you think these other ecosystems are not as good? Ethereum has a bigger community, man. I don't know. The Ethereum guys—the non-ETH guys—are impressed with that. That's one thing I will say for sure. The narrative, the control of the narrative, they are super, like really, really good at that. Their whole content and how they produce content and convey it to people is really strong. I don't know, I feel like Solana is kinda good at it, but like even they're not as good because like there's not as many people that understand localized flea markets and what Quik is, like what all the upgrades are, there's no way, like not at all.	Climate
40. I mean, I'm continuously impressed by people that I talk to in the Ethereum community. They'll name like the EIP and the number, and then they'll be able to articulate everything, where like in Solana, I mean, yeah, localized fees like with Jump and the Fire Dancer client. I think at the Solana Breakpoint event with Fire Dancer, they demoed on pretty standard hardware with a good amount of cores, I think like 24 or 32 cores, Solana hardware doing—or the Fire Dancer client doing 600,000 TPS. But you really don't hear the community talking about that or really showing it too much, and so yeah, Ethereum's—they're pretty good.	Technology, Innovation, Advancement
41. I don't know, maybe it's like a time thing because I feel like—I think it's been around for much longer. Well, if I have like what, how many years—like I think it launched in 2014 or 15. See, somewhere around there, so it's kind of like a five or six-year head start. That might be why those are people that have been reading the EIPs since they started, so that definitely makes a good reason. I think the wealth effect happened or helped a lot too. I mean, with everybody getting the opportunity to buy—well, a good amount of people getting the opportunity to buy ETH at the ICO, and then a couple of years prior to all the ICOs happening, and then kind of got the second chance when ETH went from like 1400 to 80.	Innovation, Technology, Development
42. And now with Solana and some of these other L1 ecosystems, I mean, Solana went from like 240 to 60 to what was it, eight? So like people having a second redemption at that as well. So it will be interesting. Yeah, I think it's going to be interesting for sure. I've always been like a bit biased toward Solana because like I literally bought it at like 1.50, so yeah, I've always been—I feel that like that wealth effect is definitely real.	"Technology  
Innovation

43. What are your thoughts? Like anything particularly on the NFT side or like gaming front that you're looking forward to? Yes, I really think—I can't play—I played a game on Solana the other day, it was actually pretty cool. It was a first-person shooter, it was okay once—it was mini, it was mini-mini Royals or mini something—mini Royal, mini Nation or something. It's like really dope. It's like you didn't even—because like what I'd be like was just playing like you would play a regular game.	Technology, Innovation, Future
44. One of the interesting onboarding pieces I think for these games is like, can you play it without a wallet initially? And then like after that, you're like, oh, if I use a wallet, then I get all these other in-game upgrades, and I get to track all my stats and my wins and losses, and I get access to different NFTs. I think the go-to-market of these games—like how they do that—it's got to be like it can't be just for crypto-native people. I think there's gonna be games that focus on onboarding everybody, and then there's going to be on-chain games that specifically target crypto-native people because they're like two different segments, I think.	Technology, Innovation, Future
45. I think that's just like a bull cycle thing. The economies have to be constructed in different ways. I think the bull market evaluations were just way too high, like the prices that people were paying to earn in-game were just unsustainable for the average person. And that's why all of them broke.	"Technology  
Innovation  
Society"
46. But if you have a game that has a sustainable economy where you don't need to pay a ton of money to play upfront, but you can earn from participating, like whether that be through microtransactions or items that don't cost a ton, I think that can work. Because play-to-earn games exist outside of crypto. Games like World of Warcraft were play-to-earn games. If you played World of Warcraft, that was a play-to-earn game. They played a lot of World of Warcraft. I don't play anymore because I would get sucked back in, but I played a lot of World of Warcraft and RuneScape back in my day. I have years logged in, literally.	Technology
47. But if you were doing all those, like I forget what they were called, the tailoring and the jewel crafting, all that stuff, if you were grinding, farming, putting hours into the game, spending hours in-game, you got profit from that because you could sell your stuff on the auction market. And then it had tangible value in real life because people would pay for the time spent in-game. So I think in crypto, that could happen in the same way, but it's just so much easier to distribute that through NFTs, with everything on-chain, and just like you're tracking your progress over time. I don't think anybody's done it really well yet, but I definitely am still bullish on that.	Technology, Innovation, Society
48. Yeah, I would love like a World of Warcraft or RuneScape-style game with NFTs. That'd be amazing. But no, I think just looking at Dune Analytics and how few users there actually are, and thinking about, all right, if you got one popular game, you could really onboard the entirety of the existing crypto users today, which I think gets me super excited.	Education, Technology, Innovation
49. Legit, I've literally been thinking about this in the same way. That's kind of how I was thinking about DFK, like when it was gonna do really well. It did do really well for a bit, but the games that do that and are sustainable long-term, I think are huge. I don't know if you've looked at like, what are the two popular ones? Illuvium—they haven't launched their main game yet, but they have stuff in beta. Treeverse, I think, looks pretty cool. But yeah, there's stuff like that. We actually have one of TCG's portfolio companies, Curio. They're launching an on-chain game, Treeverse, that's launching pretty soon.	Technology
50. But there's a ton of different games. I think this year, it's like this is the year after people have spent a year plus in development, actually building out the game. Yeah, games take a long time to make, and crypto is way too fast for the pace, I think, of developers. So I do agree, I'm excited for them to actually launch and see which ones have the sticking and staying power because they could definitely bring a lot of users on.	Literature, Science, Ethics
51. On the TCG side, like you said, you were interested also in some of the social aspects. Is there anything that you guys have been following on that front that you're excited about for this year? Yeah, so some of our portfolio companies, like Medallion, I really like them, they're really cool. So they focus on the intersection of music artists and their fans. It's creating a dynamic relationship where the fans are able to track their entire history of their fandom over time and then interact with other fans socially through a social media application and see who else is at this concert with them.	Innovation
52. So I think that's kind of cool because it's merging the physical and digital experiences together. But there's other stuff like that as well that we're interested in—just really bringing more people into the space through these hybrid experiences. I think that's the main one that we've been really excited about, and it's still really early days for that, but yeah, I think that's going to be one of those things where over the next few years, we see how it actually plays out.	Education, Technology, Innovation
53. Music artists often face challenges in identifying their most dedicated fans or reaching out to specific subsets of concert attendees. Blockchain and NFTs simplify this process, enabling artists and fans to connect more effectively. This innovation excites many, including those involved in creative industries.	Technology
54. Platforms like YouTube, which shares about 50% of ad revenue with creators, have been one of the better avenues for creators to monetize their work. However, with Elon Musk’s acquisition of Twitter, there’s curiosity about how the platform might evolve to support creators better. Similarly, decentralized platforms like Glass XYZ, which operates on Solana, allow creators to get paid directly by their audience, cutting out the large corporations that typically take a substantial share.	Technology, Education, Innovation
55. Blockchain and NFTs offer exciting possibilities for improving interactions between creators and their audiences across various industries. As these technologies mature, they are expected to become more dominant in areas like podcasting, providing new ways to connect and engage with audiences. The journey of diving into crypto and podcasting has been rewarding for many, including those who initially struggled to find their place in the community.	Education, Technology, Innovation
56. The crypto market often follows cyclical patterns, with periods of accumulation and innovation occurring during bear markets. The year 2023 is expected to resemble 2019, where major cryptocurrencies rebound, and significant developments in infrastructure and applications take place. Innovations in areas like liquid staking derivatives, Cosmos app chains, and Roll-Ups are anticipated, with those who actively seek out and engage with these emerging technologies likely to find success.	Efficiency
57. Being active in the crypto space, especially during quieter market periods, is crucial for discovering new opportunities and building valuable relationships. Early engagement, even before projects are fully developed, can lead to significant advantages. This proactive approach not only helps in learning about new technologies but also in establishing connections within the crypto community.	"Technology

Innovation"
58. For those interested in connecting with experts or investors in the crypto space, platforms like Twitter remain the best place to reach out and engage in meaningful discussions. Direct messaging on Twitter is recommended, with the possibility of sharing contact information for further communication. This open approach fosters collaboration and helps individuals stay informed and connected in the rapidly evolving world of crypto.	Sustainability, Innovation, Technology
59. Did that hurt? I mean yeah, you thought I was joking, I wasn't joking. Uh, yeah, next time I won't go out the entire week before there is a next time. Are we going to see for sure? I can't, I can't go out like that, it's crazy.	Sustainable, Innovation, Technology
60. Um, so before I was in crypto, I was a software engineer. I was a full stack developer, um, actually at Capital One. So before that, I studied computer science and modern business at Georgia Tech. Um, I had an Emerging Technologies class at Georgia Tech as part of my minor, um, and that was my intro to crypto. So it was like 2016, and that's when I learned about what Bitcoin was and why it was important. Didn't buy any in 2016.	"Technology  
Innovation

61. I graduated from Georgia Tech in 2017, and when I graduated, um, I was working as a software engineer, and then on the side, I was just trading crypto. So my mentor at my job was a big crypto guy, Bittrex, all that stuff. He's like, 'Yo, you're smart, you should learn how to trade in addition to doing all the software engineering stuff.' So that's when I started trading and basically been trading crypto since 2017.	Innovation
62. Made some money first cycle, lost some money, and stayed around, was active on crypto Twitter, learned a lot from all the older guys like Kobe, Loomdart, Trader M, all those people. Um, and then the next cycle happened, and the market just went crazy, and I was still trading then. Um, did pretty well that cycle and then went full-time crypto in 2021, and I've basically been full-time crypto since then. Um, I worked as the head of research at TCG Crypto for a little bit, um, and now just doing my own thing.	Technology, Innovation, Society
63. Was there a single moment aside from figuring out what Bitcoin was in University that you thought, 'That's it, that's what I want to do full-time, I'm going to eventually gear my career choices towards that?' No, not really, not in school. Um, my plan when graduating was actually just like to do the software engineering thing, like I'm doing software engineering. Um, planning to do that and like do well with that 'cause I was good at that.	Health, Wellness, Fitness
64. But then as I got like more active in crypto, just like more active in the space, I kind of like took a liking to it more. Um, and I really just like trading. Like I like trading more than I liked coding. Um, so that's really how that shift happened. Is it because one's a lot more profitable than the other one, or is the anxiety or no, it's, it's a combination of things. I like trading. It's like you immediately pay yourself out. Like if you're right, you immediately get paid. If you're wrong, you immediately lose money.	Health, Nutrition, Exercise
65. Um, whereas like in a career or whatever, it's like you're working a certain amount of hours and then like whenever you finish your project, you get some, um, like, um, excitement, I guess, through there. But it's different. In trading, it's just like boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. It's constant.	Analysis
66. my favorite moment is definitely like all the people that are excited and like have tailed my trades and made money. Um, people come up to me like, 'Yo, you made me this much money, you made me this much, you made me a millionaire.' Um, people just like really, uh, grateful, honestly. Like they say, 'Dude, like you changed my life, literally.' That's the coolest part for me.	"Innovation  
Sustainability

67. people that have been following me for like years, and so I'm posting charts to like two likes, three likes in 2017, 2018, it's just I'm posting all my ideas and stuff then. My trade journal in 2020 literally had a private page, probably like 100 people on it. Um, and I was posting every single trade, like every week I was posting all my trades, all my trade ideas, all my thesis, and just posting, posting, posting, posting.	Technology
68. they saw I was literally posting the entire, like I didn't miss any of like, any time I was just missing, um, just constant with it throughout the whole cycle. So people that saw that, they see that like I actually did the work to get to where I'm at now. And a lot of people that like on the tail end of it don't really see all that. Um, that's the coolest part for me is just like, um, seeing that I actually did like impact people.	"Technology  
Innovation

69. my least favorite part, it's kind of in the same vein. It's like, so I have close to 400,000 followers now. The issue with that is there's always going to be some people who are mad at you regardless of what you do. It's going to be somebody who lost money or oversized on some trade or like took, like misinterpreted what you said.	Education, Innovation, Sustainability
70. you think you're a big account. So that's probably like my least favorite part. That's just like dealing with that on a daily basis, I guess, like crazy DMs sometimes, like on, on different platforms and everything. Um, but there's nothing like too crazy. I would say that the positives outweigh the negatives a ton.	Education, Innovation, Sustainability
71. the Solana Crossroads, the conference. Um, so Step Finance team, I think they've done a great job, like putting together this event. Uh, I've been to Breakpoint before, but I've never been to Solana Crossroads. And I think like the in-person events where it's like developers, traders, community members, um, just people who are interested in the space all come together in the same place and get to learn, um, from each other, each other all at the same time.	Travel, Adventure, Exploration
72. Crypto is, the in-person events are really important for crypto because we are an overly online community and we're still early. So it's like seeing people that you interact with online, like in person is really important for building those connections. And I was saying on stage, um, like one of the reasons I had such strong conviction in Solana last year, even when a lot of people didn't, was because I was at Breakpoint in Lisbon in 2022, right before FTX happened. And I talked to all those founders, talked to traders, talked to people active in the ecosystem. And I knew that SPF was not a big like piece of why they were building on Solana.	"Innovation  
Technology  
Sustainability"
73. I also knew that people had a ton of conviction in the chain. And you really only see that from in-person conversations. You can't really get that from online interaction with people. Um, so yeah, I was just about to ask you actually, what were you discussing on stage? Was it the ups and downs of Solana or what was the main gist of it? Uh, we were discussing how to onboard the next billion users and like what that looks like, kind of how far we are in that process, what applications are going to do that, um, and like how can we help people get there and then like why is it important for us to get there.	Innovation, Technology, Future
74. I think it'll be people. I mean, I think it'll obviously be a combination. Um, I think AI is going to be interwoven into everything that we do moving forward, uh, but I still think people are going to be active on-chain. I don't think everybody's going to be just, just AI agents interacting.	Education, Technology, Innovation
75. I think people underestimate how much of an impact AI is going to have, not only in, um, like, just generally, but in crypto. Yeah, I do think people have an underestimation of that, um, but I'll say the general thinking is probably that's like people, the next billion.	"Technology

76. People, I don't, uh, people were like kind of joking with me going up to it. They thought I was joking when I was like, 'Yeah, I'm not really training all that much.' Um, they’re like, 'Oh, he really was serious.' Like, I'm tweeting during the week. I'm out till 7:00 AM the first day. Second day, I'm out till 6:00 AM. Third day out till whatever AM. People thought I was joking. I wasn't. I wasn't joking. Uh, yeah, next time I won't go out the entire week before there is a next time.	Technology
77. I would say I've seen Solana at its lowest, highest, lowest, close to some in between now. I think that one of the biggest milestones for Solana was, I would say, the first thing is establishing community. And that was in 2021. So Solana did a really good job of establishing community early on, like that whole run-up from what was like $150 to like $260 or whatever it was in that time period. They did a great job of onboarding developers to the ecosystem, um, like onboarding people through communities, NFTs, and everything else, um, building that online presence, building that in-person presence. Um, they did a really good job of building the community there. And that community was the only reason that when stuff got bad, um, there were still people that had, um, conviction in Solana long-term.	Technology
78. I'll say the second thing is like the pace of development on Solana is crazy. I think compared to other L1s, like in 2022, there was a period when the chain was literally unusable for people. Um, and they had to fix a ton of that, um, to make sure people would be able to use the chain moving forward. And that took a lot of time, but I think like only a few months, I think during 2022 is when they got like all those fixes through. And then when 2023 came around, people were still in their heads thinking, 'Oh, L1 doesn’t work,' but they were more paying attention to all the dev updates that happened, um, and all the work that had been done behind the scenes. So I think that's like the two, two biggest things I definitely would say. Um, and so like the speed of innovation is crazy. Like whenever something happens, it's like, they're on it very fast.	Health, Wellness, Fitness
79. Talking about the community, I fully agree with you. Um, but within the, uh, the demographic or, or let's say within the developer community, what has made Solana unique? Um, that's, that's a good question. I honestly do not know all the other developer communities all that well, um, to do a like comparative analysis on it. But from my point of view, it seems like it's very top-down, like Anatoly leads very much, um, very directly in how he thinks about developing on Solana. Um, he’s like, 'Do things fast, break things, and then fix them.' And it's like, if it, if it breaks, okay, cool, we'll fix it, we'll figure it out. Um, he’s like very forward-thinking in that way. I think it's kind of the same thought process he has around, um, like hardware on Solana. Like, 'We want to use the most out of this hardware that we can. We're not really concerned, um, with doing the opposite.' I think it's really like forward-thinking.	"Technology  
Innovation  
Society"
80. I don't think Solana is an ETH killer. Um, I honestly think they're trying to do two very different things. Like it's not even really a good comparison because what Solana is trying to do is be like an integrated L1, which is like, um, execution, consensus, settlement all happened on Solana, on the L1. Whereas Ethereum is really pushing all the execution off to these L2s and these rollups. So Ethereum's focus is different from Solana. They just want to be the most secure, most safe, um, settlement layer. And then all the rollups are kind of that thinking of, oh, let's break things fast. Let's do things as fast as possible. And like, let's use alternative VMs versus the EVM. Like all that innovation kind of happens on rollups. Whereas with Solana, it's like everything is on the L1. So they're not even really comparable. Like ETH doesn't want to have a ton of activity on its L1 anyway. It's not trying to do the same thing. So Solana is doing, I think, a better comparison is like Ethereum to stuff like, uh, Dimension, Anisha, um, like projects like those. And then Solana is probably more comparable to stuff like Monad, like SE, um, like Aptos, those type of L1s.	Technology, Innovation, Future
81. I was around after DeFi summer and all the people who were active on testing out new protocols were basically the degen's, like all, all the degen traders who are active on-chain, um, like playing around with Yearn, Compound, like a lot of those same people, I think, well, not all the same people, but a lot of those people with that same thought process were the ones active early on. Radium, like on Solana when it was like just a web wallet before Phantom and Backpack and all those, um, like before Metaplex even existed. Um, I think it's really like the degen's in crypto lead a lot of the first testing of all these protocols and it's like that pretty consistently. And then I think retail was big on Solana in 2021 because of NFTs. That was like a big thing for, for Solana.	Innovation, Technology, Future
82. Um, which is why I was kind of surprised, uh, that people expected DEX trading volumes to remain so low in Solana last year, like in 2023, it was very common for people to say, 'Yeah, there's no trading volume on Solana. That's never going to go up, never going to be close, um, to Ethereum.' And people would say, 'Ethereum is the place for memes and alts to be traded because meme coins can do well on ETH because once the fees are high, nobody wants to sell.' And I'm like, 'That doesn't make sense.' Like the same reason that Solana was big on NFTs, it's going to be the same reason that Solana is a great user experience for trading. Like anybody can trade on Solana with very low costs and it's very fast. Um, so that was my whole thesis in 2023. I'm like, whenever people realize that everything's going to skyrocket and that's what's happening currently.	"Technology  
Innovation

83. Well, in crypto, price leads a lot. So it was sideways between like $5 and $30 and that range for like nine, ten months. And there were a ton of people like smart institutional money, like smart retail traders who were just bidding in that range. And then like eventually when there's more demand and supply and it broke out above $30, there was a ton of people who were like, 'Oh, now I need to pay attention to Solana.' And then when people started actually bridging over to Solana, they were like, 'Oh, what am I going to buy?' Then Bonk went from like what, $30 million to whatever it is now, like a billion. Um, and then people were like, 'Okay, we can buy alts on Solana now. There's a proof of concept. Bonk just went crazy. Okay, what else is Solana going to do?' And then that's when all the memes started popping up. Like a lot of people started launching their tokens. I think Jito was big. The airdrop for Jito was really, really big for people. Um, cause that was a wealth effect similar to what happened with Uniswap on ETH. And all those people got the Uniswap airdrop, like, 'Oh, now I have $1,000 to play around on-chain with.' And it was the same thing for Jito, but it was even more substantial because there were not as many users as there were on ETH that were active on Solana using Jito.	"Sustainability  
Innovation  
Technology"
84. I was telling people all of last year, it's like, 'You're not competing with a ton of people now cause it's not consensus that Solana is going to do well.' Um, so yeah, Jito airdrop, a few, Jupiter airdrop, um, there were a few other airdrops that did well. And then just literally, um, all the memes just popped off immediately as Solana was going up.	Technology, Innovation, Society
85. it wasn't frustrating because I was, I was proving right. It really wasn't because people were like, 'Yeah, he's been saying this for, for months now. We've been listening to you nonstop. Like we believe you. Okay. We believe you.' That's good. Yeah.	Education, Technology, Innovation
86. I mean, publicly it has a huge impact. Like everybody associated SBF as a scammer. FTX was the worst. And he was the biggest proponent of Solana that entire last cycle. It's like, 'Okay, Solana is a scam.' Like that was just the connection that people made. I think it had a really, really big impact during that whole like last year of 2023. Nobody even wanted to buy Solana. Like, 'Oh, that's dead. That's the next, that's EOS, whatever else, other L1 that died.	"Innovation  
Sustainability  
Technology"
87. I think it didn't have an impact on people who really had conviction in Solana. And that's the most important part. Like the developers, founders, everybody who was raised in the ecosystem, um, and had been building in the ecosystem even pre-SBF owned, like a lot of those protocols didn't even have tokens out yet. Uh, it didn't waver their conviction and it didn't waver a lot of the early Solana, I think, retail community that was active. It didn't change their conviction either. A lot of people who were active in NFTs in 2021 stayed active. A lot of people who were like the first users of Radium, Solit, all those, um, like Samo, those early coins, they were still active.	"Innovation  
Technology  
Sustainability"
88. it didn't change the perception for them but to the outside world, it changed a lot of perception. And it's still like right now being changed back to, 'Oh, like Solana is a valid chain for people to build on.' So that's like still shifting, but it definitely had an impact at the time, like a huge impact. It had a massive impact on the price as well. Yeah, it went, yeah, it went from $40. I remember I was at Lisbon, I was at Breakpoint and Solana had like, it was June 2022 was when 3AC and like 3AC, I think blew up because of Luna. Like the Luna crash was May 2022. Then June was like the aftereffects of that. Luna broke a ton of stuff.	Storytelling
89. I remember the second low that all the majors made in June, Solana didn't make a lower low. Ethereum and Bitcoin made lower lows comparably to the Terra crash, but Solana didn't. I was like, 'Okay, like we're good. It's already, it's already bottomed. There's nobody left to capitulate and sell here.' And I was at Breakpoint in, I think it was September or October of 2022. Um, and the energy there was great. Like everybody was super excited about the future of crypto. Founders were super excited. Community was super excited. There were a ton of really good, uh, announcements made there. Like, I think the Google Cloud partnership was announced there and price was rallying. I think we were around like $40 and then we get on a plane, go back to the U.S. and literally while we're on the plane is when FTX crashed and it went from $40 to $8 in like a week. It went down like 80%.	Technology, Innovation, Communication
90. it's definitely a combination of things. Um, I would say in crypto, like distribution and attention is just as important as the tech is because if you have great, you can have great tech and no community, and you have great tech and no community, that's almost worse than having great community and no tech. Because even if the stuff doesn't work, if you have a community of people that think it works, they're not going to sell anyway. So it's like, that's honestly the worst, a worst situation.	Economy, Policy, Innovation
91. it was definitely a combination. Like the reason that if you look at Solana metrics compared to ETH now, like Solana is doing as much meme volume as ETH is right now. So in comparable DEX volumes as ETH is right now, there's equal amount of daily active users on Solana as there is on ETH. Um, a ton of the other metrics objectively are on par with Ethereum, and the only reason that can exist is because of the tech, uh, like tech behind the scenes. So like you can do fees that are a hundred X lower than Ethereum, but you also have a hundred X amount of activity, which is why they're like kind of comparable in how much, um, the chain is making or profiting. Um, but that only works if the tech works. You can have the community, but you can only do that if the tech works.	Technology
92. it was part of it, honestly, partly luck because of when it came to market. So when it came to market in 2019 or 2020, um, the alt L1 thesis was super weak because the prior cycle when ETH did okay with the ICOs, all the alt L1s that were like zero, there was nothing that really got built on them. Um, so there was no proof that like an L1 could be able to compete with ETH long term. And that's when Solana came out. And then you had DeFi summer, which happened in mid-2020.	Innovation, Technology, Sustainability
93. So ETH was kind of like the champion that cycle. People saw like these apps are real. This is stuff that people can use. Like there's money being deposited on chain, like in hundreds of millions of dollars for the first time. Um, okay, this makes sense. So ETH is like, ETH is the one. And when Solana came out, there was nobody thinking like, 'Oh, there's going to be other L1s that are doing the same thing ETH is doing.' So it was partly that because it was able to trade in market, I think around like 100, 200 mil, um, for a long time. And like all that, that allowed retail to get a really low entry on Solana. And that's another part of the reason that the community of Solana is so strong.	Education, Technology, Innovation
94. Whereas now all these L1s, they could be kind of like on equal playing field tech-wise with Solana, but they're coming out at like $5 billion valuation or like whatever, like $7 billion valuation. And so you just have like people who are in from 50X, not 50X, like, or whatever, 10X lower, um, comparably. And so it's just a lot harder to build community starting at that point. It just takes time. I think a lot of these other L1s don't have that time aspect yet of like the community forming.	"Technology  
Innovation  
Society"
95. I think it was a really good slogan that like the, the marketing team at Solana came out with this past cycle during 2023. A lot of people, I think it originated on Twitter, but essentially what it means is like, there are things you can do on Solana that you can't do on ETH and other L1s.	Innovation
96. you can't do on ETH because ETH only does 15 transactions per second. So anything that you need like, um, really heavy load of transactions, you can't do on ETH, only possible on Solana. In the same way that like anybody can like dollar cost average into meme coins, a dollar a pop basically for free. You can't do that on ETH because when activity spikes, it's really expensive to transact on chain. So again, only possible on Solana. I think it's kind of a slogan for what's possible to build on the chain. And also the user experience is way better on Solana than other, other chains.	Climate
97. I think some of the trends that are super hot right now, obviously meme coins. I think memes have been a great vehicle for onboarding retail this cycle in the same way that NFTs were last cycle. Like it's really easy for somebody to understand, okay, Doge with hat, or Pepe, or frog, or this cat, dog, whatever.	Innovation
98. I think memes have done a really good job of kind of like, it's like a Trojan horse for getting people, um, into all the ecosystems. That's been really big. I mean, it's hot, leading the market for a while now, past like six months.	Climate
99. I think AI is going to be really interesting this cycle. Um, early 2023, a lot of the like AI coins popped off hard when ChatGPT dropped, which was like crazy. People were like, oh, AI, what can I buy that's AI in crypto? And all the AI coins just immediately ripped. Um, but there's a lot of like really cool applications, I think, that are, that are going to be built there, whether it's like the decentralized compute applications where it's like artificial intelligence takes a ton of GPU power to run their models, train their models. And crypto, um, you kind of can align incentives with a ton of people globally to use their spare GPU power to do that and train these models.	Technology
100. And then I think the other piece of it that's really interesting is going to be the AI agents. So AI agents, meaning like these autonomous agents that can do work for you, transacting on-chain, interacting with protocols, um, doing all these other things in crypto that you typically would be doing manually. So if you have like a smart agent that's able to take trades for you, find the best yield in crypto across multiple different blockchains, that's super powerful. Um, and I think a lot of people are working on, um, implementing protocols like that.	Health, Nutrition, Wellness
101. I think EVM, EVM L2s are overhyped. That's my biggest thing. And the reason I say that is because if you're going to push execution off of Ethereum to these rollups, the only reason you're doing that is because you want them to be a lot more performant, a lot faster than the default Ethereum L1 is. And if you just use the EVM again, it doesn't really make all that much sense. Like you don't have the issue with state bloat and some other things, but, um, I think it makes a ton more sense to do like alternative VM structures. Um, in that way, I like, like, what's a good one? Like Arbitrum, I think is working on Stylus, which is going to have like alt VMs, like Move is working on their Move VM rollup. Um, there's a ton of different, different rollups kind of working on that. But yeah, I think like pure EVM rollups don't really make all that much sense. I'll say that's overhyped.	Health, Nutrition, Wellness
102. I think that, I don't know. I think ordinals make a ton of sense on Bitcoin. The reason I think they make a ton of sense is because with NFTs, provenance is really big, and ordinals on Bitcoin are inscribed literally like directly into the Bitcoin blocks. So I think the most, um, like the biggest ordinal collections, I think, are going to do really well. I'm not as certain on if Bitcoin L2s make as much sense for DeFi and everything else. And the reason I say that is because you kind of run into the same issue that you have with Ethereum L2s, where it's like these L2s need to have a substantial, um, increase in UX from whatever you're doing on Bitcoin currently. So like if it's just another EVM L2 on Bitcoin, I'm not really that excited about that. Um, and I'm not sure how they, they actually are like going to work in practice, um, when people start using them.	Diversity, Inclusion, Equity
103. I mean, I like, I like Base a lot actually, the Base L2, Coinbase's L2. That's probably my second favorite ecosystem. Um, the reason it's my second favorite ecosystem is because of how much mindshare they have in the US with crypto and how many customers they already have on Coinbase. Coinbase has like, I want, I want to say 80 million or something users on their literally their centralized exchange. So it's like, if you have Base, which is a rollup connected to that, and you figure out a way to get even what, like 10% of those users directly on chain, you immediately have 10 million people ready to use whatever applications are on chain. And there's not a lot of applications in crypto that have 10 million daily active users really, like at all. Um, so I think they have a super, um, big first-mover advantage there with like already having users.	Technology
104. Favorite application, whether it's to use, whether it's to talk about. I hear some whispers. Honestly, I mean, the application I use the most is Jupiter, like Jupiter for trading and everything else. I think the application that is like probably the most underrated I think is Drip. So Drip is really cool. Um, it's like an NFT platform where digital artists can put out their work. People get dripped like, um, NFTs from all their favorite artists that they subscribe to. And then immediately when that artwork is dropped there, it's listed on, um, I think Tensor, I think it's listed on Tensor and available to trade. But there's a lot of cool things you can do with content on Drip.	"Innovation

105. And it's also one of the best applications for like user retention. Like people come back and use that app, um, on a consistent basis without even needing really to speculate on anything. Um, so I think that would probably be the two, one, two. Yeah.	Innovation
106. Do you see one swallowing or, you know, you know, eliminating another one? Yeah. I mean, I think a lot of the L1s just aren't, aren't going to be successful. Same way that I think a lot of the L2s just aren't going to be successful. I think you're going to have a few winners in L1s and a few winners in L2s that win the race to like getting people to build on chain, getting the community. And then even if you have kind of like equal playing field tech-wise, it's like, everybody's already on this chain. Why would I move to, to something else? And I think they, they went out in that way. Um, but I think we're super early. So like I, I'm hesitant to be like, yeah, this is the winner for the next 20 years. I think crypto is going to be around for a long time.	Climate
107. People that sort of spread their capital across a bunch of chains. I know a lot of people would, would, would like to hear you say, maybe don't, maybe don't leave too much of your money in that basket. So do, do you have any sort of tips for people just to where to spread their capital? Um, I mean, Solana, Solana and Base are my main two ecosystems, I guess, where a lot of my money is. Like I've, um, pretty active on like Frontech on Base. I use like, I think Frontech is another cool, uh, like application on Base. Forecaster is another cool application on Base.	education, technology, innovation
108. Yeah, for sure. I think, I think social FI is interesting. Um, just because of how much of a trend there's been with like influencers and content creators in web two, that's a big thing now. People trust these individuals a lot more than they trust these companies. And a lot of these influencers are making a ton of money from ads and everything else in web two. But crypto and like the financial incentives, at least currently are even stronger than they are in web two. Like the top Frontech people made like 300, 400 K plus all fees and everything else. The top, like, um, creators like on Twitter don't even make close to as much, like comparably. I just, because of how capital is kind of distributed right now in crypto and how early the space is, there's not as much users present and there's like a lot more capital I think invested that gets distributed to a smaller bucket of people right now.	Technology
109. My trajectory is kind of crazy. I've gone from developer to trader, now to influencer, creator. Um, I would say, whatever you want to do in crypto, like that you're passionate about, crypto is a space where you don't need any credentials to get to where you're at. Like, if you prove yourself to other people, you do the right things in public, um, people see what you're doing, you're going to earn whatever it is, like regardless of where you came from or your background or anything else. Um, so I'd say that's the biggest thing is like, you can have that mindset where anything is possible really in crypto.	Education, Innovation, Technology
110. But if you want to be a really good trader, you need to be active in looking at past cycles, like studying charts, talking to people who have been around for a while and how they look at the market. Um, and then kind of like looking at past industries and how those work and like how early stages of when industries form, how those work. Um, and yeah, just literally practicing a ton. If you want to be a really good trader, you just have to practice a ton. You're going to have to lose money first before you get good at being a trader. Um, I don't really have any tips on the influencer content creation stuff. It's really just, it just kind of happened. I, I don't really know.	"Technology

111. Yeah, Bullpen, I'm co-founder of Bullpen. Um, it's essentially a social trading platform. Um, what we're really focusing on is having a place for whether you know a lot about crypto, know nothing about crypto, you can come into Bullpen, get your discovery, learn about whatever's trending in the market, what traders are talking about, what's going on in the space, um, get your news and everything there in the same place that you can trade all these altcoins.

112. I want to one-click trade like whatever, Pepe, I want to one-click trade like Popcat, I want to one-click trade anything. Um, you can do that in the app in the same place that you get all of your alpha from. And the way that we're doing that, um, we have a crypto-specific LLM that's learning on a ton of different Telegram chats where all these traders are active and present. And then from all those channels, we're pulling out all the most relevant information, what people are talking about the most. Um, and then from other like trending things on-chain and metrics like that, basically giving people, okay, this is what's trending today, this is what people are talking about, this is the alpha today, it's like what's going on in the market, um, giving that to people in the feed and then letting them trade, uh, whatever they're interested in from there.	Technology
113. So that's one of the biggest things, like distribution is super big for us. We want to get this in the hands, um, of as many people as possible and as many chats as possible. Um, then yeah, the more people that are using the app, the better the LLM is, and like the better information you're going to get, get back from people. So yeah, that's definitely the key.	Innovation
114. I've been in crypto for a really long time, and one of my biggest things is like, all my friends ask me, 'Okay, Z, I know you do crypto, how do I learn about crypto?' And whenever that question happens, I got to be like, I'm going to pull this article from this, I'm going to pull this article from this, I'm going to talk to you for an hour, then I'm going to come back, I'm going to set you up with a wallet, then I'm going to show you how to trade on, uh, Coinbase. And after I show you how to trade on Coinbase, I'm going to show you how to trade on the DEX, and after I show you trade on the DEX, I'm going to show you how to trade on this DEX.	Travel
